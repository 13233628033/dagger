Dagger 2
========

A fast dependency injector for Android and Java.

About Google's Fork
-------------

Dagger 2.0 is a compile-time evolution approach to dependency injection.  Taking the approach
started in Dagger 1.x to its ultimate conclusion, Dagger 2.0 eliminates all reflection, and
improves code clarity by removing the traditional ObjectGraph/Injector in favor of
user-specified @Component interfaces. 

This github project represents the Dagger 2.0 development stream.  The earlier 
[project page][square] (Square, Inc's repository) represents the earlier 1.0 development stream.  
Both versions have benefitted from strong involvement from Square, Google, and other contributors. 

## [Dagger 2's main documentation website can be found here.][website]

Status
------

  - ***Release Version:* N/A**
  - ***Pre-Release Version:* N/A**
  - ***Snapshot Version:* 2.0-SNAPSHOT**

Dagger is currently in active development, primarily internally at Google, with regular pushes
to the open-source community.  Snapshot releases are auto-deployed to sonatype's central maven
repository on a clean build with the version tag `2.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Dagger 2.0 is pre-alpha and should be used with caution, though it is usable.  Stable 
pre-releases will be made as stable points in 2.0's development occur.

Documentation
-------------

The Dagger project will undergo a documentation re-vamp in preparation for 2.0.  In the mean-time,
you can get an initial picture of Dagger 2.0's direction from [the original proposal][proposal],
[this talk by Greg Kick][gaktalk], and discussions on the dagger-discuss@googlegroups.com 
mailing list.

Also, Javadocs are updated on every merge and are [available here][latestapi]

Installation
--------

You will need to include the `dagger-${dagger.version}.jar` in your
application's runtime.  In order to activate code generation you will need to
include `dagger-compiler-${dagger.version}.jar` in your build at compile time.

In a Maven project, one would include the runtime in the dependencies section
of your `pom.xml` (replacing `${dagger.version}` with the appropriate current
release), and the `dagger-compiler` artifact as an "optional" or "provided"
dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger</artifactId>
    <version>${dagger.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId>
    <version>${dagger.version}</version>
    <optional>true</optional>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Upon release, downloadable .jars will appear via search on Maven Central. You'll need
[Dagger][dl-dagger], [dagger-compiler][dl-dagger-compiler] and [javax.inject][dl-inject].

Pre-release directly downloadable jars of the snapshots are available for [dagger][dagger-snap] and [dagger-compiler][dagger-compiler-snap] from sonatype's snapshot repository, and are built on a clean build at head.
